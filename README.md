Easy Calendar is the easy solution to managing a busy schedule.  Built with Ruby on Rails and designed with the freelancer in mind, easyCalendar allows a user to manage their appointments from numerous points of interaction. Interfacing with the Google API, easyCalendar allows users to sync their own calendars where they can create, edit, and delete appointments on either platform. Users can also manage appointments through SMS messaging via Twilio and can broadcast open appointments to their own clients as well as allow their clients the capabilities to schedule and cancel appointments solely through a text message.
